    "## **Microservices**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Microservices** are a software architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Focuses on a specific business function:** Each microservice addresses a specific business domain and handles a single piece of functionality.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Communicates over a network:** Services interact through APIs or messaging systems, often using protocols like HTTP/HTTPS or messaging queues.<br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * **Can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently:** Each service can be built, tested, and deployed without affecting other services.<br>\n",
